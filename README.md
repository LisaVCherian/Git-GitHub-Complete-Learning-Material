## 1. What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br>
Git has many advantages, it is used to track changes in the source code and it allows multiple developers to work together. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

## 2. What is GitHub

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books.
Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

## 5. Git Init

This is basically performed to initialise a folder/repository so as to perform git operations like adding, committing etc.<br>
Inorder to initialise local repositry with git we can run the following command to the respective folder location using terminal.<br>
      ```
      git init
      ```<br>
press enter...<br>
Great... now your local repository has been initialized with git.

## 11. Git Checkout

The Git Checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository.<br>
```git checkout branch_name```      This command is used to switch from one branch to another.<br>
```git checkout -b branch_name```   This command creates a new branch and also switches to it.

## 12. Git log

Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. Generally, the git log is a record of commits.<br>
```git log```     This command will display the last commits.

## 13. Git status

The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.<br>
```git status```  This command lists all the files that have to be committed.

## 14. Git merge

Git merging combines sequences of commits into one unified history of commits.
```git merge branch_name```   This command merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch.
